# [SIRDs - Single Image Random Dot Stereogram DLL](http://forum.thegamecreators.com/?m=forum_view&t=91214&b=5)

## What is a SIRD?

A SIRD (Single Image Random Dot Stereogram) is a variation of one of those '[Magic Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Eye)' things you've no-doubt seen a million times.

As the name suggests, instead of (like the Magic Eye) having a regular pattern to its image, it uses Random Dots, which allows for the animation of the Stereogram.


## What good is that?

Just for fun - I always like to look at things in a different way, and this is about as different as you can get!


## Um...

Yep, there's a few issues with it.
The first, and most noticable one is the framerate. Unfortunatly, I can't do much about that, since I've optimized it to the best of my ability.

The second is that weird tearing effect as the cube turns to a 45degree angle. That one I also can't do much about since it's a flaw in the algorithm that I am using.
Nothing major, just when you're using it in your game, try to make sure nothing is at 45degree angles!


## Thanks...

First and fore-most, the White-Paper I got all the information about SIRDs from [The AbSIRD Project](http://www.leweyg.com/download/SIRD/AbSIRD/essay.html).

Next up, I'd like to thank Cloggy for releasing his D3DFunc DLL's source. Without it, I would have been stumped for some of the functionality.

Finally, I'd like to thank the guys at TGC and some of the moderators here on the forum for helping me out over the last month and a bit; Cheers!
